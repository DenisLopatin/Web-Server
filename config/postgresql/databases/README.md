### SQL dumps

Here are your `sql` dumps. Just put your `my_db.sql` file here.

This file will be ignored when starting the `postgresql` container.

### Important

Don't forget to add instructions `CREATE DATABASE [db_name]` and
`USE [db_name]` to the beginning of the sql file.

Show log for `docker container logs [database_container_id]`
